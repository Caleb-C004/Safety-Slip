# Safety-Slip
Device to detect for credit card skimmers within a point-of-service terminal card swiper

Using a Raspberry Pi, our team built the system with a breadboard, voltage sensor, battery, and some conductive metal

We wrote the software to process the data, parse our incoming volts, and then read to an output.
